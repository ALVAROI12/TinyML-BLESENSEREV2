# TinyML-BLESENSEREV2
TinyML research and projects
This GitHub repository contains code and resources for working with the TinyML-BLESENSE-REV2, a compact and powerful platform for developing Internet of Things (IoT) applications using machine learning (ML) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The repository includes example projects that demonstrate how to use the platform to perform a variety of tasks, including image classification, gesture recognition, and sensor data analysis. The code is optimized for use with the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers framework, making it easy to train and deploy ML models on the device. The repository also includes detailed documentation on how to set up the hardware and software for development, as well as guidance on how to integrate your own custom ML models into your IoT projects.
